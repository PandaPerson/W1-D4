    <h2>A Brief History</h2>
    <p>My dad, Shawn Ivey, went to school for computer science and so I've grown up around technology all my life. I got my first laptop before I was 10 and used it mostly for gaming. For my 16th birthday, I used <a href="https://www.newegg.com/">Newegg</a> to select computer parts and built my first PC.<br>I've been interested in programming for a while and love the <span style="color:red">challenge</span> that it brings. I'm glad that I'm finally able to attend a program that focuses on programming and doesn't require unnecessary classes before graduating.</p>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <pre>
1. Reading
2. Golf
3. Gaming
4. Programming
    </pre>
    <p>I would have used an &lt;ol&gt; or &lt;ul&gt; for my hobbies, but that was not a requirement in this project and I needed to use the gt and lt symbols.</p>
